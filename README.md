# Expense-Tracker_ReactJS
Assume that you are sharing a flat with your friend or some other person and you share the various bills like cooking, electricity, Bike Maintenance(maybe), Rent, etc. Each time either of you will pay the amount. You are keeping note of the expenses and at the end of the period of sharing a flat, the person who spent an excess amount shall pay the other. All this process is done manually as on date.
